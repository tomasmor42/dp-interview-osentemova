"""Prerequisites:
 - A database server (if you have no current one, then mysql will do fine)
 - The python driver for that database installed and working

In this bit of work, you will need perform the following steps:
 - Retrieve an archive
 - Extract the relevant data from the archive
 - Upload that data to your database server
 - Perform any steps necessary to prepare that data for querying
 - Generate queries about that data
 - Store the output of those queries in CSV format

The code presented here is incomplete. Every TODO entry has steps
involved that you will determine the best way to implement. You will
know that you have completed everything when running this script
completes successfully. When you have completed the exercise, zip up
the output files and your source code and return it to the email
supplied along with this test.

You may use any libraries you wish. The only restriction on this is
that Pulsepoint must be able to run your code, so the libraries must
be publicly available. If you do use any, please add them to the
REQUIRES string below.

You may rewrite as much of this source file as you wish. It is only
being provided as a possible skeleton, and is not required to have
this as the final form.

The COLUMN_DEFINITIONS provided below match the csv file that you will
download. In the original archive, there is also a file named
"codebook.txt" that provides definitions for each of these columns.
